# 🎯 QLP: Quantum Layer Platform
**An enterprise-grade, event-driven, microservice-based AI orchestration platform.**

QLP empowers you to build, validate, and deploy complex software systems using a fleet of specialized AI agents. Our architecture ensures scalability, reliability, and high-quality, secure code generation.

---

## 🏛️ Architecture Overview

The QLP ecosystem is composed of several, independent microservices that communicate via a Kafka event bus. This design allows for massive parallelism and resilience.

- **Intent Service**: The public-facing API that accepts user requests.
- **Orchestrator Service**: The "brain" of the system. It builds a graph of tasks and manages the overall workflow state using Redis.
- **Agent Worker**: A scalable pool of workers that execute tasks using specialized agents (e.g., CodeGen, TestGen).
- **Validation Service**: An intelligent quality gate that uses a multi-layered approach, including an AI-in-the-Loop (AITL) refinement cycle, to ensure code quality and security.
- **Persistence Service**: The final step in the pipeline, storing validated artifacts in a durable location.

## 🚀 Running with Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to run the entire QLP stack locally is with Docker Compose.

### **1. Prerequisites**
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) are installed.

### **2. Environment Setup**
Create a file named `.env` in the root of this project. This file is used by `docker-compose.yml` to inject your Azure OpenAI credentials.

```
# .env
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="<your-azure-openai-api-key>"
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="https://myazurellm.openai.azure.com/"
```

### **3. Launch the Platform**
From the project root, run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will:
- Build the container image for each microservice.
- Start containers for Kafka, Zookeeper, and Redis.
- Start all of the QLP microservices.
- You will see logs from all services interleaved in your terminal.

### **4. Submitting a Job**
Once all services are running, you can send a request to the `intent-service`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/intent \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "query": "Create a simple web server in Python using Flask that returns hello world."
}'
```

You can then watch the logs in your `docker-compose` terminal to see the entire orchestration workflow in action!

### **5. Shutting Down**
To stop all the containers, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where `docker-compose` is running. To remove the containers, run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

---

## 🧑‍💻 Manual Development

While Docker is recommended, you can still run services individually. Each service is a standalone Go application in the `services/` directory. For example, to run the `intent-service` manually:

```bash
export KAFKA_BROKERS="localhost:9092"
export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
export AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="your-endpoint"
export PORT="8080"

go run ./services/intent-service/cmd/intent-service/main.go
```
